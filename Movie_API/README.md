# Movie Information

This Python Script uses the requests library to fetch movie information from the OMDB API based on a movie title provided by the user.

Flow:
1) User enters a movie title.
2) The program constructs an API request.
3) It retrieves the movie's details if available and prints them, or an error message if something goes wrong.
